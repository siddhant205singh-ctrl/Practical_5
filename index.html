		<h3>How to Build Good Study Habits</h3>
      <img src= "Studyhabbits.avif" alt = "Photo.com" width=" 400" height= "400" >
		<p>Building strong study habits is the foundation of academic success. First, establish routine and structure. 
	<br>Create a consistent study schedule that blocks out specific times for learning and review, treating these sessions like mandatory appointments.
	<br> Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to maintain concentration. 
	<br>Crucially, practice Spaced Repetition, where you review material over increasing intervals rather than cramming, which solidifies long-term memory.</p>
